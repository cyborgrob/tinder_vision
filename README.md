# Tinder Vision

ML project to train a model to swipe intelligently on Tinder. Currently, the model scores ~80% on swiping, which I'm aiming to improve.

There is a Youtube video going over the Instagram data sorter app which can be found here: https://youtu.be/hf70xSEbXJY

The TinderGradio notebook uses Gradio to build a simple interface where you can upload a photo and the model will predict whether it's a swipe right or left.
